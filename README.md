# OOSEProject

This project was developed in collaboration with Dylan Stogianni for the module object-oriented software development. Documentation and introduction to the project can be found in the file "oose_Projekt_Conway_s_Game_of_Life_PaulVoelkel_DylanStogianni.pdf". In order to run this project on your own device you need to set up the save and load paths in order to match your project filepath.
It's a gradle project, which uses FXML files for the user interface and GSON in order to save (/ load) grid states in (/ from) JSON format inside files.
